# Gate cards — how the pipeline asks for your decision

Every human gate in the ADLC pipeline — the pause at the end of `/spec`, `/architect`, `/implement`, `/review`, `/wrapup`, and inside `/bugfix`, `/task`, and `/autopilot` — presents the same **gate card**: a compact, scannable summary that ends in a decision. This page is the reader's tour; the authoritative spec the skills follow is [`core/GATE-PROTOCOL.md`](../core/GATE-PROTOCOL.md). How many gates a REQ gets depends on its profile — see `core/GATE-PROTOCOL.md` → Profiles.

## The idea

A gate card is not a report. It's built to answer three questions at a glance, in order:

1. **What's done?** — the artifacts this phase produced (FYI).
2. **What needs *you*?** — the decision-bearing items: a proposed decision record (ADR), a stress-test finding that held up, an open question. If nothing, it says so.
3. **What's the decision?** — the last line, and the only thing you must act on. On Claude it arrives as an `AskUserQuestion` with that gate's real options; the card is the context.

Every card also carries a one-line **recommendation** (`MY READ`) — the option the pipeline would pick and why — so a clean gate is one keystroke and a risky one is obvious.

## Anatomy

```
GATE <n>/<N> · <Phase> · <REQ> — <short title>
   <verdict — one line: what's ready, and whether anything needs a call>

READY       terse, FYI — the artifacts / counts this phase produced
NEEDS YOU   the decision-bearing items, prioritized (omitted when there are none)
CHECKS      this gate's validation, compact — ✓ / ⚠ per check

MY READ     the recommendation + one-line why
Decision →  the gate's options, each stating what happens next
```

`READY` / `NEEDS YOU` / `CHECKS` / `MY READ` are a **menu of sections each gate can use, not a fixed form** — each gate uses the ones its phase needs and can rename or add its own. A spec gate is often just verdict + `CHECKS` + decision; a review gate leads with `FINDINGS`; `/wrapup` shows the wrap-up checklist; `/autopilot`'s final review opens with a `RUN SUMMARY`. The order — done, needs you, recommendation, decision — is what never changes.

## Example — the architect gate (full profile)

```
GATE 2/5 · Architect · REQ-014-payment-retries
   ready to review — 2 items need your call

READY       architecture.md · 6 tasks in 3 stages · new decision ADR-007
            exploration.md · stress-test ran: full pass
            task order: T1,T2 → T3,T4 → T5

NEEDS YOU   ⚠ ADR-007  retry backoff strategy — accept or reject
            ⚠ fixed    double-charge on retry — the fix is in the
                       Approach section; please confirm it
            ? open     how long should idempotency keys live?

CHECKS      ✓ criteria covered · ✓ no cycles · ✓ conventions · ✓ tests concrete

MY READ     approve — the flagged risk is fixed; the new decision is low-risk

Decision →  approve (move on to implementation) · revise <what> · abort
```

Note the task order is shown as **compact text**, not a rendered picture: the card must read cleanly in a plain terminal, where Mermaid doesn't render. The full rendered diagram lives in `architecture.md`, where it renders in Obsidian, GitHub, and IDE preview. That's the rule for diagrams everywhere in the pipeline — see the [diagram conventions](fidelity-matrix.md) and the templates.

## Example — a combined gate (standard profile)

A `standard` REQ folds spec and design into one **Plan** gate: one block per covered phase, each keeping its own CHECKS line.

```
GATE 1/3 · Plan · REQ-015-export-button
   spec + design ready — recommend approve

SPEC        ✓ criteria testable · ✓ goal specific · ✓ assumptions explicit · ✓ no design · ✓ non-goals
READY       architecture.md · 3 tasks in 2 stages · no new ADR
CHECKS      ✓ criteria covered · ✓ no cycles · ✓ conventions · ✓ tests concrete
            profile: standard (3 files, no sensitive surface)
```

## Markers

Cards use one small, consistent vocabulary (no emoji): `✓` pass · `⚠` needs attention · `?` open question · severities spelled out (`critical` / `major` / `minor`; trivial shown only as a count). The full list lives in `core/GATE-PROTOCOL.md`.
