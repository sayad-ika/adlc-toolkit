description: Streamlined pipeline for bug fixes. Report + investigate → Diagnose gate → fix + regression test + review + wrap-up → Ship gate (a Verify gate is added only when review finds a critical/major). Use for defects, not for new features. Larger or scope-creeping bugs should be re-framed as a REQ via /spec.
---

You are running the bug-fix workflow. This is a slimmer cousin of `/proceed` with two gates (three when a fix round is needed), each showing every check of the phases it covers. Use it for bugs — defective existing behavior — not for new features.

## When to use

- A defect has been reported.
- The fix is bounded: clear symptom, clear repro, expected to touch a small area of the codebase.

## When NOT to use

- The "bug" is actually a missing feature. Use `/spec` + `/proceed`.
- The fix requires designing a new pattern or making an architectural decision. Use `/spec` + `/proceed`.
- Multiple related bugs need fixing together. Use `/spec` with a multi-acceptance REQ.

If during investigation the bug turns out to be larger than expected, **stop and surface** — recommend re-framing as a REQ.

## Preflight

1. **Read the toolkit ETHOS** (`$TOOLKIT_PATH/ETHOS.md`) **, the gate protocol** (`$TOOLKIT_PATH/core/GATE-PROTOCOL.md`)**, the voice guide** (`$TOOLKIT_PATH/core/VOICE.md`)**, and the vault layout** (`$TOOLKIT_PATH/core/VAULT-LAYOUT.md` — where work records live on disk; never hard-code a path under `specs/`, `bugs/`, or `sprints/`) — the shared gate-card format used at every gate below. Already read in this run (an orchestrator or the previous phase loaded them) and no context compaction since? Don't re-read them; when unsure, re-read.
2. **Load vault basics.** `.adlc/CLAUDE.md`, `now.md`, `hot.md` (last 20), `config.yml`, `context/conventions.md`, `context/architecture.md`.
3. **Assign the BUG ID.** Mint it per `config.yml` → `req.id_scheme` (default `sequential`), applied to the `BUG` namespace, using the one scan from VAULT-LAYOUT's `mint` rule: `find .adlc/bugs -maxdepth 4 -type d -name 'BUG-*'` — depth 4 so it covers every month bucket and every author folder, not just yours. `sequential` takes max+1, padded to 3 (`BUG-NNN`); `prefixed` (`BUG-<req.prefix>-NNN`) narrows the `-name` to `BUG-<req.prefix>-*` and keeps the depth — scoped to your own author folder it would re-mint someone else's live IDs; `ticket` takes the issue key when invoked with an issue ref + `sources.issues` (e.g. `BUG-842`), else falls back to prefixed/sequential, noting it. Throughout, `BUG-NNN` denotes the assigned ID in whatever form the scheme produced.
4. **Create the bug folder.** Read `config.yml` → `layout.partition`: `none` gives `bugs/BUG-NNN-<slug>`; `month-author` gives `bugs/<YYYY-MM>/<author>/BUG-NNN-<slug>`, where `<YYYY-MM>` is today's month (the month the bug folder is created — it never changes afterwards) and `<author>` is the first of `layout.author`, `req.prefix`, initials from `git config user.name`, or `_`. `mkdir -p` the parents, then create the folder. **That vault-relative path is `<BUG_PATH>` for the rest of this protocol** — it carries no `.adlc/` prefix, so every path below reads `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/…`. Agent dispatch prompts get it written out in full — the agents resolve nothing.
5. **Resolve a source reference (optional).** If invoked with an issue reference (e.g. `/bugfix #8`) or an issue URL, and `config.yml.sources.issues` is set (not `none`), resolve it with the same mechanism order as `/spec` (CLI such as `gh issue view <n> --json title,body,labels,comments,author,createdAt` first → MCP → URL fetch; default repo from `sources.repo`, a full URL overrides). This is the *same resolver* `/spec` uses. If a label indicates the issue is a feature rather than a defect, note it — the Diagnose gate's `reframe` path will route it to `/spec`. If nothing resolves or no service is configured, print one line (`couldn't reach <service> for <ref> — drafting the report manually`) and continue; the seed is strictly additive.
6. **Finish a shipped bug.** If `now.md`'s active item is a BUG at a cleared ship gate, run /wrapup's merge detection first.

## Phase 1 — Bug report (no gate — feeds Diagnose)

### Draft

Copy `templates/bug-template.md` to `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/bug.md`. Substitute placeholders and fill content from the user's description — **or, if a source reference was resolved at preflight step 5, seed from the issue**:

- Symptom — issue title + body
- Reproduction steps — issue body and **comments** (repro steps and stack traces usually live in the thread, not the opening post)
- Environment — any OS/browser/runtime/version mentioned; leave blank fields for the user to confirm
- Severity estimate — map from labels (`P0`/`critical` → critical, etc.) or propose one
- Reporter / Reported — issue author and creation date
- Add the issue link to the bug's "Related" section for provenance.

Seeded content is a **draft, not truth**. The runnable-repro requirement is unchanged: a tracker issue often lacks clean repro steps, so fill what the issue gives, then — if repro steps still aren't runnable — ask follow-ups in chat. **Don't proceed to investigate without a runnable repro** (or an explicit "I can't reproduce — investigate from this stack trace"), seeded or not.

### Initialize pipeline state

`.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/pipeline-state.json`:

```json
{
  "bug": "BUG-NNN-<slug>",
  "kind": "bugfix",
  "createdAt": "<ISO>",
  "currentPhase": 1,
  "completedPhases": [0, 1],
  "gateState": "deferred",
  "currentPhaseGate": null,
  "gates": ["diagnose", "ship"]
}
```

The report's checks (symptom concise · repro runnable · expected-vs-actual concrete · environment captured) and a feature-not-defect label (→ reframe) go on the Diagnose card.

## Phase 2 — Investigate (gate: `diagnose`)

### Dispatch codebase-explorer

**Dispatch by exact agent name.** If the agent type isn't available (not installed, or the sync hasn't run since it was added), **stop and tell the user**: "`<agent>` isn't installed — run the toolkit sync, then re-run this step." Never absorb the agent's work into the main session as a fallback: inline work runs at the session's model instead of the agent's tier (a haiku-priced exploration silently becomes an opus-priced one), and for reviewers it destroys the independence the gate depends on — the same context that wrote the code would be reviewing it.

Targeted recon — not blast-radius-wide, but focused on the area suggested by the bug's repro and stack trace.

```
BUG: BUG-NNN-<slug>
Bug report: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/bug.md
Repo path: <repo-path> (read-only — the bug branch is created after the Diagnose gate)
Focus: <function or module suggested by repro>

Find:
1. The code path the bug runs through
2. Existing tests covering the area
3. Similar past bugs (search hot.md, gotchas.md, lessons/)
4. Any gotcha or lesson that applies to the affected file

Write to: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/investigation.md
```

### Diagnose

After the explorer returns, write the root cause to `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/bug.md` under "Investigation log":

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — root cause

The actual cause, with file:line references. Why it produces the symptom.
```

Sketch a fix approach in the bug.md "Fix approach" section. Two or three bullets — concrete enough that the user can evaluate whether to proceed.

While diagnosing, if the codebase quirk that produced the bug or any insight from `investigation.md` deserves vault capture, append a candidate to `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/lesson-candidates.md` (source tag `bugfix-investigate`). The Phase 5 verdict step decides whether it becomes a lesson, gotcha, or discard.

### Gate card

Emit per the gate protocol — combined: **Report** and **Investigation**, each with its own CHECKS line. Set `currentPhaseGate: "diagnose"`, `gateState: "awaiting"`, write `.awaiting-approval`.

- **Verdict** — "root cause found — recommend approve", "needs a runnable repro", or "scope looks bigger than a bug (→ reframe)".
- **REPORT** — symptom concise · repro runnable · expected-vs-actual concrete · environment captured.
- **READY** — root cause `<file>:<line>` in one sentence; fix approach in 2-3 bullets; related vault entries (`[[…]]`).
- **NEEDS YOU** — a missing / non-runnable repro, an uncertain diagnosis, scope creep, or a feature label (→ reframe). Omit if none.
- **CHECKS** — diagnosis matches repro · fix in scope (no creep) · regression-test plan concrete.
- **MY READ** — recommendation + why (never approve without a runnable repro).
- **Decision** — on Claude, an `AskUserQuestion`: **approve** (→ branch + fix), **revise** (report or diagnosis), **reframe** (scope too big → feature REQ), **abort** (discard; no branch exists yet, so nothing to clean).

```
GATE 1/2 · Diagnose · BUG-NNN-<slug>
   root cause found — recommend approve

REPORT   ✓ symptom concise · ✓ repro runnable · ✓ expected vs actual · ✓ environment
READY    cause: src/pay/retry.ts:88 — retry re-enters before the guard clears
         approach: move the idempotency check above the retry loop; add a guard test
CHECKS   ✓ diagnosis matches repro · ✓ in scope · ✓ regression plan concrete

MY READ  approve — tight diagnosis, contained fix

Decision →  approve · revise <what> · reframe · abort
```

On `approve`: clear gate, advance. On `reframe`: archive `bug.md`, call `/spec` with the bug content as input, exit this skill.

## Phase 3 — Fix (no gate)

### Establish the work path

Same pattern as `/architect`'s preflight step 4. Read `config.yml.workflow.isolation`. In `auto` or `branch` mode, verify `git -C <repo-path> status --porcelain` is clean (refuse and surface if not) and then run `git -C <repo-path> checkout -b bugfix/BUG-NNN-<slug>`. In `worktree` mode, run `git -C <repo-path> worktree add <repo>/.worktrees/BUG-NNN-<slug> -b bugfix/BUG-NNN-<slug>`. Update `pipeline-state.json` with `isolation`, `workPath`, `branch`, and `worktree` (null in branch mode). Append to `hot.md`: `## [DATE] work-path-set | BUG-NNN-<slug> | <mode> at <workPath>`.

### Dispatch task-implementer

```
Task: Fix BUG-NNN-<slug>
Bug report: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/bug.md
Investigation: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/investigation.md
Work path: <workPath>
Approach: <copy from bug.md "Fix approach">

Implement:
1. The fix itself
2. A regression test, written and run **before** the fix (record the failing assertion in bug.md's Investigation log), then passing after it
3. Any cleanup necessary

Draft commit message to .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/commits-draft.md.
Run tests; verify they pass.
Surface lesson candidates to .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/lesson-candidates.md per your skill instructions (source tag remains `implement-task`; the bugfix folder is the candidates location).
Do NOT run git mutations.
```

### Verify the fix

After task-implementer returns:

- Confirm the regression test exists and passes
- Confirm running the original repro steps no longer produces the bug
- Confirm no other tests broke

Any of them failing is a mid-phase stop (surface + options: retry · revise approach · abort), not a gate. When all pass, set `gateState: "deferred"` and go to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Review (gate: `verify`, only when needed)

Slimmer than `/review`. Dispatch **only** `correctness-reviewer` and `reflector` (the two most likely to find issues in a bug fix). Skip quality and architecture unless the fix touched layering or introduced significant new code.

Reviewers read the working tree (committed or not) exactly as `/review` step 1.5 does; commits are checked against the git log at the ship gate.

When dispatching, pass `Candidates file: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/lesson-candidates.md` so the reviewers append to the bugfix folder (not a REQ folder), and `Output file: .adlc/<BUG_PATH>/review-log.md` — the agents' default. State the write budget in the dispatch prompt as `/review` does: summary ≤5 lines, finding ≤8 lines after its table, section ≤12KB, ≤12 candidates of ≤4 lines. Tags from those agents remain `review-corr` and `review-reflect`. The verdict/narrative split applies from the first pass, same as `/review` and `/task`: reviewer narrative goes to the log, `verification.md` holds the digest. Re-review rounds follow `/review` step 6 — the log keeps every round, the verdict file collapses resolved findings, and from round 3 the gate card leads with `Re-review round <N> · verdict file <N>KB`.

### Findings

Consolidate from `review-log.md` into `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/verification.md` with the same shape as `/review`'s verdict file — digest table, roster line, consolidated findings — but only two reviewer sections.

### Route after review

If any **critical or major** finding is open: insert `verify` before `ship` in `gates`, set `currentPhaseGate: "verify"`, `gateState: "awaiting"`, write the marker, and emit the **Verify** card — findings-led like `/review`, plus a `FIX` CHECKS line (regression test fails before, passes after · repro no longer triggers · no other tests broke) — with **approve · fix <ids> / fix all · revise · abort**. Never approve with a critical open. Fix rounds follow `/review` step 6. When none is open (or once the Verify gate clears), set `gateState: "deferred"` and go to Phase 5 — minor/trivial findings left ride on the Ship card.

```
GATE 2/3 · Verify · BUG-NNN-<slug>
   2 findings — 1 needs a call

FINDINGS  maj  correctness — retry guard skips the zero-amount path
          min  reflector — LESSON pattern repeated
FIX       ✓ regression test (fails before, passes after) · ✓ repro gone · ✓ no other tests broke

MY READ   fix the major, then approve — the guard gap reopens the bug

Decision →  approve · fix <ids> · fix all · revise <what> · abort
```

## Phase 5 — Wrap up (gate: `ship`)

Same as `/wrapup`, but with the bug-specific knowledge capture:

### Process candidates and write vault artifacts

Mirrors `/wrapup`'s "Process candidates" step, but bound to the bugfix folder:

1. **Read `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/lesson-candidates.md`.** If absent, sweep `bug.md`, `investigation.md`, and `verification.md` for capture-worthy patterns and write them as candidates before continuing.
2. **Check candidates against existing lessons on this branch and on `origin/<base-branch>`** — exactly `/wrapup` step 2 (`git -C <workPath> ls-tree …`, the age line, the skip line when the ref is missing).
3. **For each candidate, verdict one of**: `promote` → new lesson, `demote-to-gotcha` → new gotcha entry, `discard` with one-line reason.
4. **Append a `## Candidate verdicts` table** to the bottom of the candidates file with the verdicts and target/reason for each.
5. **Mandatory minimum for bugfix:** at least one non-discard verdict (promote OR demote-to-gotcha). A bug fix that produced zero non-discard verdicts is a missed knowledge opportunity — push back on yourself before issuing the gate prompt; if you genuinely conclude there's nothing to keep, surface that explicitly in the gate prompt for the user's call.
6. Write the resulting lessons (minimum-required fields only per the lesson template) to `knowledge/lessons/` as `LESSON-<BUG_ID>-<n>-<slug>.md` — the ID is namespaced under this bug, scan per `core/VAULT-LAYOUT.md` → `mint(lesson)` with `<WORK_ID>` = the BUG ID — and append gotchas to `knowledge/gotchas.md`. Then rebuild `knowledge/lesson-ledger.md` as `/wrapup` step 4 does.

### Repo-doc sweep

Same as `/wrapup` step 1, scaled to the fix: grep the doc surface (`config.yml` → `docs:`, or `README*` + `docs/`) for any symbol, flag, default, or behaviour the fix changed; list stale claims with corrected facts under NEEDS YOU; apply on approve. A fix that changes no documented behaviour says so in one line.

### PR draft

`bug-fix-pr-draft.md` with:

- Title: `fix(scope): <short description> [BUG-NNN-<slug>]` (or project's bug-fix title format from conventions.md)
- Body: summary, reproduction (from bug.md), fix description, regression test description, lessons/gotchas captured

### Merge checklist

Same shape as `/wrapup`'s `merge-checklist.md`.

### Source write-back (optional, gated)

Same rule as `/wrapup`'s step 5a. Only if `config.yml.sources.write` includes the issue tracker and this bug was seeded from (or links to) an issue: draft the comment/transition into `.adlc/<BUG_PATH>/source-writeback.md` (e.g. "Fixed in PR <link> — BUG-NNN-<slug>", `→ Closed`). Never auto-send; surface it at the ship gate and execute only on explicit approval. An external write — it always stops for your OK (even under `/autopilot`), and is limited by `sources.write` and `autonomy.sources`.

### Gate card

Emit per the gate protocol — mirrors `/wrapup`'s ship gate, bug-scoped. Set `currentPhaseGate: "ship"`, `gateState: "awaiting"`, write `.awaiting-approval`:

- **Verdict** — "PR + vault ready — run the checklist".
- **READY** — PR draft (`bug-fix-pr-draft.md`); merge checklist; vault capture in one line (candidates `<N>`; promoted `<L-BUG-NNN-n>`; gotchas `<^gNN>`; hot entries), then the dedup basis (`dedup vs origin/<base> as of <age>` / skipped).
- **NEEDS YOU** — a drafted comment for the issue tracker, shown before sending (it is never sent without your OK); or, if no lesson or gotcha was kept at all, a confirmation — bug fixes usually teach something, so confirm that's right or reply `revise: capture` to take another pass through `bug.md` / `investigation.md` / `verification.md`. Omit if neither applies.
- **FINDINGS** — the minor findings left from review, one line each. Omit if none.
- **CHECKS** — with no Verify gate: `FIX` (regression test fails before, passes after · repro gone · no other tests broke) and `REVIEW` (counts · correctness, reflector) lines; then regression test in the diff · commit drafts in git log (`manual` with no Verify gate: ⚠ until the user runs them — name them under NEEDS YOU; `commit` modes: they land on approve) · no debug artifacts.
- **MY READ** — recommendation + why.
- **Decision** — on Claude, an `AskUserQuestion`: **approve** (run the merge checklist), **fix** `<ids>` (when findings are present), **revise**, **merged** (finalize after you merge), **abort**. After a fix round on this card, re-run the candidates verdict for new candidates and refresh `bug-fix-pr-draft.md`'s fix description before re-emitting.

```
GATE 2/2 · Ship · BUG-NNN-<slug>
   PR + vault ready — run the checklist

READY       PR: bug-fix-pr-draft.md · merge-checklist.md
            knowledge saved: 1 gotcha (g14) · 1 activity-log entry
NEEDS YOU   (none — knowledge capture done)

FIX         ✓ regression test (fails before, passes after) · ✓ repro gone · ✓ no other tests broke
REVIEW      0 findings · correctness, reflector
CHECKS      ✓ regression test in diff · ✓ commits drafted · ✓ no debug

MY READ     approve — fix is shipped-ready; knowledge captured

Decision →  approve · revise <what> · merged · abort
```

On `merged` (replied or detected, per `/wrapup`): finalize `pipeline-state`.

## Constraints

- **Commits follow `git.mode`** (`.adlc/config.yml`, default `manual`) — same rules as the full pipeline. In `manual`, draft `commits-draft.md` and the user commits. In `commit`/`commit+push`, commit the fix on the bug's own feature branch on the approval of the gate that covers the code — Verify, else Ship (and push it, ff-only), never on a protected branch.
- **Two gates, every check.** Report, investigation, fix and review checks all appear on the Diagnose / Verify / Ship cards; a phase without its own gate still halts on failure.
- **Never expand scope mid-bug.** If during investigation the fix grows past a small area, surface and recommend reframing.
- **Always add a regression test.** No exceptions. A bug fix without a regression test is borrowing against future debugging.
- **Always capture knowledge.** At least one non-discard verdict (promote OR demote-to-gotcha) at Phase 5. The verdict step exists precisely to keep the vault high-signal — discards are allowed, but a bug fix that ends in all-discards needs explicit user confirmation, not a silent skip.
- **Source seeding is additive; source write-back is gated.** Reading an issue to seed the report (Phase 1) never blocks — if it fails, draft manually. Writing back (Phase 5) is off unless `sources.write` lists the tracker, drafted to `source-writeback.md`, and sent only on explicit approval — never silently. Same rules as `/wrapup`.

## Output artifacts

Per `BUG-NNN-<slug>`:

- `bug.md` (report, with investigation log appended)
- `investigation.md` (from codebase-explorer)
- `commits-draft.md`
- `verification.md` (verdict digest) and `review-log.md` (reviewer narrative)
- `bug-fix-pr-draft.md`
- `merge-checklist.md`
- `lesson-candidates.md` (created or appended to across phases 2-4; verdicts appended at Phase 5; persists as decision history)
- `source-writeback.md` (only when `sources.write` is configured and a write-back was drafted at Phase 5)
- `pipeline-state.json`
- Vault updates: gotchas, lessons, lesson-ledger.md (rebuilt), hot.md, index.md
